Update 1.0 (Callbacks)

During this assignment I was introduced to callbacks functions. The program requests for a user to input their name to start the program. After that I was able to use math module to determine a random energy level for the user. User's energry level was used to determine if they had enough energy to complete each task with increasing energy level requirements. If the individual is able to complete all task the program will let them know all tasks have been completed. 

Update 1.1 (Promises)

During this assignment I was introducted to promises functions. This program will request for a user to input their name. The program will assign a random energy level for the individual and see if it's able to complete each task. If the individuals energy level is too low to complete the next task the program will return the last task they completed before going to sleep. 

Updated 1.2 (Async/Await)

During this assignment I was introducted to async/await functions. This program will request for a user to input their name. The program will assign a random energy level for the individual and see if it's able to complete each task. If the individuals energy level is too low to complete the next task the program will return the last task they completed before going to sleep.
