During this assignment I was introduced to callbacks functions. The program requests for a user to input their name to start the program. After that I was able to use math module to determine a random energy level for the user. User's energry level was used to determine if they had enough energy to complete each task with increasing energy level requirements. If the individual is able to complete all task the program will let them know all tasks have been completed.
